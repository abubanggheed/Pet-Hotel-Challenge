# Pet-Hotel-Challenge
This is a project designed to practise my skills as a developer.

### Set-Up
- run npm install to get the used modules
- create a postgressql database called "pet_hotel"
- in "pet_hotel" run the lines of code in database.sql to create the neccesary tables
- start the server using the start script: npm start
### Features
- Ability to add and delete owners and pets
- Clicking on a pet or owner on the table allows you to edit that information
- Can delete owners and pets
- History of completed stays tracked on a separate table
- Clicking on the table head sorts the table rows by that column
### Future work
- Adding images to the dashboard
- Adding images and other additional styling to the site
- Adding a notice on the dashboard if there are no registered owners
- reducing the dashboard get routes down to 2, / and /desc, and use search string parameters to determine what for what column the table is being ordered
